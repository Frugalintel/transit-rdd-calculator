To do

[] Finish the theme / color changing in minecraft theme. the presets are not great.

[] build 3 more full reskins
-Fallout 4 Pip-boy theme (legacy+) (RGB color change)
-Modern minimal with apple asthetic (glass?) (dark and light mode)
-Moversuite style clone (minor color change)

[] make Region accounts rather than using email. this will be easier to track as well.
-Region 1
-Region 2
-Region 3
-Region 4
-Region 5

[] change the sounds to use actual minecraft sounds (if possible)

[] Refine the training mode from the Trainees perspective.
-Interactive feature to walk you through the process of doing a date chnage.

-use your own real scinario by answering questions that guide you to the end. the end will be a checklist of things you need to do (out of training) along with the button to copy output to use on next steps.

[] Refine the training mode from admin side.
-full tree with all outcomes
-easy to read and edit
